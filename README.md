# Project: Capstone-Online Website

> Online website for a concert built with HTML5 and CSS3

This is the last project of the first module in Microverse on HTML and CSS, I built a website for a concert based on the design idea of [Cindy Shin](https://www.behance.net/adagio07) - [CC-Global-Summit-2015](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015). 
The page is responsive, for mobile: up to 768px, and desktop: from 768px.
The project is fictional just to reach the established requirements, I don't posses any rights for the pictures, logo-brands, videos and artists' names used on it.
